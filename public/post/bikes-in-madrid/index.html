<p>As other cities in Europe, Madrid is becoming more bike friendly. At the same time, the city council is commited with open data and has been releasing a lot of information <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/">here</a> about several issues in the city. A service that has captured my attention is <a href="https://www.accessiblemadrid.com/en/blog/bicimad-public-bike-rental-service-madrid">BiciMad</a>, the public bikes that can be used within the metropolitan area.</p>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>There are two main datasets associated with BiciMad. Information on users since 2014 and inf</p>
<p>I begin with the information associated with bike docks corresponding from BiciMad. These data are hosted directly on the <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/">website</a> of the Madrid’s city council. I load the data with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/README.html"><code>import</code></a>.</p>
